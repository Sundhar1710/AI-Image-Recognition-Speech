# AI-Image-Recognition-Speech

This project is an AI-powered application that performs **image recognition** and provides **speech output** for the detected content. It allows users to upload an image, analyzes it using a machine learning model, and speaks out the recognized object(s).

## 🔍 Features

- 🎯 Image recognition using deep learning
- 🔊 Text-to-speech output
- 🖼️ Upload and analyze any image
- 🧠 Uses pre-trained models for object detection
- 🗣️ Converts labels to human-like speech

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)**
- **Flask / Streamlit** (for UI, if applicable)

## 📦 Installation
